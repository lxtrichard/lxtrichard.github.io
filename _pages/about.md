I am a senior undergraduate from School of Mathematical Sciences, Zhejiang University with a major in Information and Computing Science.

My research interests lie predominately in the area of **Computer Vision** and **Machine Learning**. Recently I mainly focus on generative adversarial network in image generation.

I am now a research assistant of [Vision and Learning Lab](http://vllab.ucmerced.edu/) at UC Merced under the supervision of [Prof. Ming-Hsuan Yang](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/). Previously, I was affiliated with ZJU CAD&CG State Key Lab advised by [Prof. Wei Chen](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/chenwei/) and a research assistant in CCNT Lab led by [Prof.Nenggan Zheng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/nengganzheng).
